            <br>
            <p>Internet is established during the year 1969 is the global system of interconnected computer networks that use the standard Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP) to serve billions of users worldwide. the internet carries information resources and services, like the electronic mail, application of world wide web, inter-liked hypertext document and many more.  Internet is a tool use to create a network that would link computer to another computer to serve billions of users worldwide. It is a networks that consists of millions of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope, that are linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies.
              <br><br>
          ARPANET – (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network) an early packet switching network and the first network to implement the protocol suite TCP/IP.(foundation of the internet) <br>

        <h1> Hypertext Transfer Protocol(HTTP)</h1>
        <div class="container" alt="Avatar" class="image">

        <p>Application layer used primarily to retrieve hypertext (on hypermedia) documents and resources on the World Wide Web, Invented by Tim Berners-Lee . In 1991 HTTP 0.9, My 1996 HTTP 1.0, january 1997 HTTP 1.1 and May 2015 HTTP 2 was release.</p>

          <h3> Operations</h3>
          <img src="img/operate.png">
          
          <p><li>Connection - Client establishes TCP connection with the IP address of hostname.com.</li></p>

         <p><li>Request - Client sends the HTTP Request to the web server.</li></p>

         <p> <li>Response - Server responds to its client's request.</li></p>

        <p><li>Disconnect- Server closes the TCP Connection.</li></p>
        </div>
         
        <br>
        <h3>HTTP Request Method</h3>
        <P><li>GET - Most commonly used HTTP method. Used to request from the server the retrieval of the source identified by the request URI .the retrieved resource is returned in the message body as and entity. And can be combined with conditional and/or range request headers to effect conditional and/or partial resource retrieval. Must be supported by all general-purpose servers. </li></P>
        <p><li>HEAD - Identical to GET, except the message body is not included in the response. </li></p>
        <p><li>POST -Request that the origin server accept the entity enclosed in the request as a new subordinate of the resource identified by the Request-URI in the Request-Line. </li></p>
        <p><li>OPTIONS-Request for information about the communication options available on the request/response chain identified by the Request-URI. This method allows the client to determine the options and/or requirements associated with a resource, or the capabilities of a server, without implying a resource action or initiating resource retrieval. </li></p>
        <p><li>TRACE - Request the server to “echo” back to the client the received request and typically used for testing/diagnostics of the request chain.</li> </p>
        <p><li>PUT - Request the server to store the enclosed entity in the message under the specified request URI.</li></p>
        <p><li>DELETE -  Request the server to delete the resource identified by the request URI. </li></p>
        <p><li>CONNECT - Reserved for use of tunneling proxy servers. </li></p>

        <br>
        <h3>HTTP Request Message</h3>
        <p><li>Safe methods - GET,HEAD,OPTIONS,TRACE</li></p>
        <p><li>Idempotent methods -HEAD,OPTIONS,TRACE,PUT,DELETE</li></p>
        <P><li>Cachable method - POST</li></P>

        <p><li>WebDAV(RFC 4918) -PROPFIND, PROPPATCH, MKCOL, COPY, MOVE, LOCK, UNLOCK</li></p>
        <p><li>Request URI</li></p>
        <p><li>HTTP Protocol Version</li></p>

          <h1>Extensible Hypertext Markup Language(XHTML)</h1>
          <p>Extensible Hypertext Markup Language (XHTML) is part of the family of XML markup languages. It mirrors or extends versions of the widely used Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), the language in which Web pages are formulated. While HTML, prior to HTML5, was defined as an application of Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML), a flexible markup language framework, XHTML is an application of XML, a more restrictive subset of SGML. XHTML documents are well-formed and may therefore be parsed using standard XML parsers, unlike HTML, which requires a lenient HTML-specific parser. XHTML 1.0 became a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Recommendation on January 26, 2000. XHTML 1.1 became a W3C Recommendation on May 31, 2001. The standard known as XHTML5 is being developed as an XML adaptation of the HTML5 specification</p>

          <p>January 2000 it was officially adopted as a W3C Recommendation:
          <ul>
            <li>XHTML 1.0 Strict is the XML equivalent to strict HTML 4.01, and includes elements and attributes that have not been marked deprecated in the HTML 4.01 specification. As of November 2015, XHTML 1.0 Strict is the document type used for the homepage of the website of the World Wide Web Consortium.</li>
            <li>XHTML 1.0 Transitional is the XML equivalent of HTML 4.01 Transitional, and includes the presentational elements (such as center, font and strike) excluded from the strict version.</li>
            <li>XHTML 1.0 Frameset is the XML equivalent of HTML 4.01 Frameset, and allows for the definition of frameset documents a common Web feature in the late 1990s.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>XHTML 1.1</li>
          <p>XHTML 1.1 evolved out of the work surrounding the initial Modularization of XHTML specification. The W3C released a first draft in September 1999; Recommendation status was reached in May 2001. The modules combined within XHTML 1.1 effectively recreate XHTML 1.0 Strict, with the addition of ruby annotation elements (ruby, rbc, rtc, rb, rt and rp) to better support East-Asian languages. Other changes include removal of the name attribute from the a and map elements, and (in the first edition of the language) removal of the lang attribute in favour of xml:lang.</p>
          <li>XHTML 1.2</li>
          <p>The XHTML 2 Working Group considered the creation of a new language based on XHTML 1.1. If XHTML 1.2 was created, it would include WAI-ARIA and role attributes to better support accessible web applications, and improved Semantic Web support through RDFa. The inputmode attribute from XHTML Basic 1.1, along with the target attribute (for specifying frame targets) might also be present. The XHTML2 WG had not been chartered to carry out the development of XHTML1.2. Since the W3C announced that it does not intend to recharter the XHTML2 WG, and closed the WG in December 2010, this means that XHTML 1.2 proposal would not eventuate.</p>
          <li>XHTML 2.0</li>
          <p>Between August 2002 and July 2006, the W3C released eight Working Drafts of XHTML 2.0, a new version of XHTML able to make a clean break from the past by discarding the requirement of backward compatibility. This lack of compatibility with XHTML 1.x and HTML 4 caused some early controversy in the web developer community. Some parts of the language (such as the role and RDFa attributes) were subsequently split out of the specification and worked on as separate modules, partially to help make the transition from XHTML 1.x to XHTML 2.0 smoother. A ninth draft of XHTML 2.0 was expected to appear in 2009, but on July 2, 2009, the W3C decided to let the XHTML2 Working Group charter expire by that year's end, effectively halting any further development of the draft into a standard. Instead, XHTML 2.0 and its related documents were released as W3C Notes.</p>
          <li>XHTML5</li>
          <p>HTML5 initially grew independently of the W3C, through a loose group of browser manufacturers and other interested parties calling themselves the WHATWG, or Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group. The key motive of the group was to create a platform for dynamic web applications; they considered XHTML 2.0 to be too document-centric, and not suitable for the creation of internet forum sites or online shops. HTML5 has both a regular text/html serialization and an XML serialization, which is also known as XHTML5. The language is more compatible with HTML 4 and XHTML 1.x than XHTML 2.0, due to the decision to keep the existing HTML form elements and events model. It adds many new elements not found in XHTML 1.x, however, such as section and aside tags.</p>
