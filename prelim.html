    	<p>Internet is established during the year 1969 is the global system of interconnected computer networks that use the standard Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP) to serve billions of users worldwide. the internet carries information resources and services, like the electronic mail, application of world wide web, inter-liked hypertext document and many more.  Internet is a tool use to create a network that would link computer to another computer to serve billions of users worldwide.
It is a networks that consists of millions of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope, that are linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies.

ARPANET – (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network) an early packet switching network and the first network to implement the protocol suite TCP/IP.(foundation of the internet)
DARPA – (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) research program to allow networked computers to communicate transparently across multiple, linked packet networks.</p>

  	<p>Application layer used primarily to retrieve hypertext (on hypermedia) documents and resources on the World Wide Web, Invented by Tim Berners-Lee . In 1991 HTTP 0.9, My 1996 HTTP 1.0, january 1997 HTTP 1.1 and May 2015 HTTP 2 was release.</p><br>
  	<p>HTTP Request Method</p>
  	 <h3>HTTP Request Method</h3>
                       <P><li>GET - Most commonly used HTTP method. Used to request from the server the retrieval of the source identified by the request URI .the retrieved resource is returned in the message body as and entity. And can be combined with conditional and/or range request headers to effect conditional and/or partial resource retrieval. Must be supported by all general-purpose servers. </li></P>
                       <p><li>HEAD - Identical to GET, except the message body is not included in the response. </li></p>
                       <p><li>POST -Request that the origin server accept the entity enclosed in the request as a new subordinate of the resource identified by the Request-URI in the Request-Line. </li></p>
                       <p><li>OPTIONS-Request for information about the communication options available on the request/response chain identified by the Request-URI. This method allows the client to determine the options and/or requirements associated with a resource, or the capabilities of a server, without implying a resource action or initiating resource retrieval. </p>
                       <p><li>TRACE - Request the server to “echo” back to the client the received request and typically used for testing/diagnostics of the request chain.</li> </p>
                       <p><li>PUT - Request the server to store the enclosed entity in the message under the specified request URI.</li></p>
                       <p><li>DELETE -  Request the server to delete the resource identified by the request URI. </li></p>
                       <p><li>CONNECT - Reserved for use of tunneling proxy servers. </li></p>

                        <br>
                        <h3>HTTP Request Message</h3>
                       <p><li>Safe methods - GET,HEAD,OPTIONS,TRACE</li></p>
                       <p><li>Idempotent methods -HEAD,OPTIONS,TRACE,PUT,DELETE</li></p>
                       <P><li>Cachable method - POST</li></P>

                      <p><li>WebDAV(RFC 4918) -PROPFIND, PROPPATCH, MKCOL, COPY, MOVE, LOCK, UNLOCK</li></p>
                      <p><li>Request URI</li></p>
