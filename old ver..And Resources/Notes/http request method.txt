GET - Most commonly used HTTP method. Used to request from the server the retrieval of the source identified by the request URI .the retrieved resource is returned in the message body as and entity. And can be combined with conditional and/or range request headers to effect conditional and/or partial resource retrieval. Must be supported by all general-purpose servers.
HEAD - Identical to GET, except the message body is not included in the response.
POST -Request that the origin server accept the entity enclosed in the request as a new subordinate of the resource identified by the Request-URI in the Request-Line.
OPTIONS-Request for information about the communication options available on the request/response chain identified by the Request-URI. This method allows the client to determine the options and/or requirements associated with a resource, or the capabilities of a server, without implying a resource action or initiating resource retrieval.
TRACE - Request the server to “echo” back to the client the received request and typically used for testing/diagnostics of the request chain.
PUT - Request the server to store the enclosed entity in the message under the specified request URI.
DELETE - Request the server to delete the resource identified by the request URI.
CONNECT - Reserved for use of tunneling proxy servers.

Safe methods - GET,HEAD,OPTIONS,TRACE
Idempotent methods -HEAD,OPTIONS,TRACE,PUT,DELETE
